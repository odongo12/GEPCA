# GEPCA
GEPCA is implemented as a Python package with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization. The core algorithm is optimized for performance using TensorFlow for deep learning components and NumPy for numerical operations. 
GEPCA employs a multilayered approach that evaluates target sequence characteristics, chromatin accessibility, DNA structural features, and historical editing patterns to generate comprehensive precision scores with associated confidence intervals. 
 GEPCA addresses a critical need in the field and advances the development of safer and more effective gene editing applications. The algorithm's modular architecture allows for continuous improvement as new experimental data becomes available, ensuring its relevance in the rapidly evolving landscape of genome engineering.
 In this paper, we present the Gene Editing Precision Calculator Algorithm (GEPCA), a novel computational framework designed to address the limitations of existing approaches and provide a comprehensive solution for predicting CRISPR-Cas9 editing outcomes. GEPCA integrates multiple layers of analysis—sequence characteristics,
structural context, machine learning prediction, and statistical confidence calculation —to generate a holistic assessment of editing precision.
